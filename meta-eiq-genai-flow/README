This meta-layer customizes the BSP to enable LLM operations on the Neutron NPU.

Please refer to the sections below for details.


I. Adding the meta-eiq-genai-flow layer to your build
=====================================================

To add the meta-eiq-genai-flow layer to your build, run the following command:
```bash
bitbake-layers add-layer meta-eiq-genai-flow
```

II. Build a eiq-genai-flow image with Neutron acceleration for LLMs
================================

This image includes custom Neutron components and installs additional tools required to run the eiq-genai-flow Demonstrator with the `--use-neutron` parameter.  
However, the eiq-genai-flow Demonstrator package is not included in the image and must be copied manually.

To build the image, run:
```bash
$ bitbake imx-image-full-eiq-genai-flow-dep
```

III. Post flash operations
==========================

Once flashed, the Neutron device tree blob (DTB) must be set manually in U-Boot.
To set the correct dtb neutron in u-boot:

* Stop the boot an u-boot stage
* List and identify the available Neutron DTB files. If flashed on an SD card, use:

```bash
u-boot=> fatls mmc 1:1
```

* Set a Neutron-enabled DTB, for example:

```bash
u-boot=> setenv fdtfile imx95-19x19-evk-adv7535-ap1302-neutron.dtb
u-boot=> saveenv
u-boot=> boot
```

Once the board has booted, the eiq-genai-flow package can be copied to the target device and executed with the `--use-neutron` parameter.
